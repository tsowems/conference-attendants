as well as 'event' messages between staff within an exhibitor and 'delegate' messages, which could be sent between delegates to allow them to 'network'. 
<br>The delegate messaging feature was primarily used by exhibitors using delegate accounts, or other delegates who used this messaging platform to advertise their companiesâ€™ to the attendees. 
The majority of messages sent were from the delegates and there was little-to-no interaction from the attendees.<br>
Meanwhile, the 'event' conversations were used by exhbitors to communicate with one another about topics such as checking the messaging functions and their plans for when to close the stand.

<br><br>Within the exhbitor_message table, it was possible to view the conversations between exhbitors and delegates. A lot of the messages were just in regard to visiting the stands, 
however there were some 'test' messages exchanged between the delegates just to ensure that the messages were being sent and delivered.
